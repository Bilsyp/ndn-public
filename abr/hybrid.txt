The provided code is a JavaScript implementation of a hybrid adap
tive bitrate (ABR) algorithm for video streaming.


The sample method takes a bandwidth sample (duration and number of bytes) and updates the EWMAs. The getBandwidthEstimate method returns the minimum of the two EWMA estimates.

Hybrid class

This class is the main ABR algorithm implementation. It uses the EwmaBandwidthEstimator to estimate the bandwidth and adapts the video quality accordingly.

Here are the key methods:

init: Initializes the ABR algorithm with a callback function for switching between video streams.
setVariants: Sets the available video streams (variants) with their corresponding bandwidths.
configure: Configures the ABR algorithm with a configuration object.
enable and disable: Enable or disable the ABR algorithm.
stop: Stops the ABR algorithm and resets its state.
segmentDownloaded: Called when a video segment is downloaded, it updates the bandwidth estimate and suggests a new video stream if necessary.
suggestStreams: Suggests a new video stream based on the current bandwidth estimate and buffer level.
adjustVariantByBandwidth: Adjusts the video stream selection based on the current bandwidth estimate.
chooseVariant: Chooses a video stream based on the buffer level.
The suggestStreams method is the core of the ABR algorithm. It calculates the buffer level and uses it to determine the video stream to switch to. If the buffer level is low, it chooses a lower-bandwidth stream; if the buffer level is high, it chooses a higher-bandwidth stream.

The adjustVariantByBandwidth method is used to adjust the video stream selection based on the current bandwidth estimate. It sorts the available streams by bandwidth and chooses the one that is closest to or below the current bandwidth estimate.

Overall, this code implements a hybrid ABR algorithm that adapts to changes in network bandwidth and buffer level to provide an optimal video streaming experience.
